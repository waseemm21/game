Classic Snake Game
Overview:

Welcome to the Classic Snake Game! This project is a nostalgic tribute to the old-school Snake game that many of us enjoyed during our childhood. Created using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game brings back those fond memories while providing a fun way to challenge your skills.

Features
    Simple Gameplay: Easy to learn, hard to master!
    Classic Design: Retro visuals that evoke nostalgia.
    Responsive Controls: Smooth movement using keyboard arrows.
    Score Tracking: Keep track of your high scores!

How to Play

    Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake.
    The objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen.
    Each time the snake eats, it grows longer, making it more challenging to navigate.
    Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body!
